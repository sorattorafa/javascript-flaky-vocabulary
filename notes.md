# Vocabulary of flaky tests in Javascript

This repository contains supplementary material of the Thesis "Vocabulary of flaky tests in Javascript" as a parcial requisite to fullfill computer scientist course of Universidade Tecnol√≥gica Federal do Paran√°, Campo Mour√£o. 

**Abstract**: *Context: Regression testing is a software verification and validation activity in modern software engineering. In this activity, tests can fail without any implementation change, characterizing a flaky test. Flaky tests may delay the release of the software, in addition to jeopardizing its quality assurance. One way to identify flaky tests is by re-running the tests, but this has a high computational cost. An alternative to re-execution is the static analysis of the code of the test cases, identifying patterns related to flaky tests. Considering this approach, however, to the best of your knowledge, only works that address Java applications are observed, although other languages, such as Javascript, are also widely used in software development.
Objective: The objective of this work was to identify flaky tests in Javascript applications without executing them, saving computing resources.
Method: A dataset was built with flaky test cases extracted from open projects hosted on Github that are implemented in Javascript. Next, a classification model was created, considering the source code of flaky tests in the Javascript language, built from the classification model established in this work.
Results: We observed that the learning algorithms considered in this study achieved a good performance in the classification of tests regarding flakiness. In particular, logistic regression had the best accuracy (0.984) and was the best in terms of recall (0.98). The vocabulary for flaky tests contains words related to asynchronous wait (e.g., 'then', 'await', 'return') and visualization and user interaction (e.g., 'layout' and 'click'). We also found two words associated with flaky test cases related to the usage of the Cypress framework:  'cy' and 'getByTestID'. The term with the most significant relevance to the information gain is 'then', which is mainly associated with asynchronous waits.
Conclusions: This work presents relevant results for identifying flaky tests in projects that use Javascript. Further studies are required to consolidate the reliable classification of tests regarding flakiness methodology.*

# Flaky dataset

Observations:

- Dataset with issues, commits, and pull requests with flaky keyword.
- Issues contais link to another issue, commit or pull request associated;
- Pull request contais a set of commits to fix flaky test;
- Commits contais fix flaky code;
- The dataset does not contains the exact 'flaky code';
- To identify flaky codes into nodejs we removed items of csv:
  - Android projects;
  - Non trivial code affected;
  - Custom suites of tests;
- Flakies smells (comments and actions who identify flakies):
  - suite of tests: `npm run test-image -- $SUITE --filter --skip-flaky || EXIT_STATE=$?`
  - remove or add fixes identifiers `xit or it.skip`
  - `this.timeout(5000); // This tests are really slow.`
  - `timeout: 10000`
  - `let it = DISABLE_FLAKEY ? xit : _it;`
  - ` /* global DISABLE_FLAKEY */ let flakeyIt = DISABLE_FLAKEY ? xit : it;`
  - `delay: 150, fireImmediately: false`
  - `// TODO: figure out why this test is flaky. Perhaps unmount of useEffect is async? itIf.skip(is('> 16.8.3'), 'cleanup on unmount', () => {`
  - `describe.skip('visualize tables', () => {`
  - ` // skipping this test for now as it's flakey. Issue has been raise: // https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/15798 it.skip('should sort the bucket names alphabetically', () => {`
  - `it.skip("clears title tag if empty title is defined", done => { `
  - `jest.setTimeout(10000);`
  - `expect(timeDiff).to.be.at.most(5000);`
  - `` This commit works around the issue by clicking the elements directly using JavaScript (instead of `WebElement#click()`). ``
  - Remove `sleepFor(1000);` and `add await browser.wait(async () => await heroesList.count() < total, 2000);`
  - `tick(500)`
  - Remove `fakeAsync` from it test
  - `this.retries(2);`
  - `describe('@flaky Click-to-select', function() {`
  - Flaky list or black list:

  ```javascript
  var FLAKY_LIST = [
    "treemap_coffee",
    "treemap_textposition",
    "treemap_with-without_values_template",
    "trace_metatext",
    "gl3d_directions-streamtube1",
  ];
  ```

  - assertFocus function:

  ```javascript
  function assertFocus(selector: string, done: MochaDone) {
    wrapper.update();
    // the behavior being tested relies on requestAnimationFrame. to
    // avoid flakiness, use nested setTimeouts to delay execution until
    // the next frame, not just to the end of the current frame.
    setTimeout(() => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        assert.strictEqual(
          document.querySelector(selector),
          document.activeElement
        );
        done();
      });
    });
  }
  ```

### Reposit√≥rios analisados

Fora extra√≠dos casos de testes destes reposit√≥rios para criar o dataset de tokens de testes.
uber/baseweb
angular/angular
angular/components
ploty/ploty_js
mobxjs/mobx
influxdata/influxdb
twbs/bootstrap

Questions:

- nos commits as vezes aparecem testes alterados que n√£o est√£o no codeaffected, provavelmente pois aquela altera√ß√£o n√£o √© referente ao flaky, deve-se estudar esses casos.
